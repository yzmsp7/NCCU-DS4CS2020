This is the repository that records my homework in "Data Science for Cyber Security" course.

## Homework

### HW#01: ZeroAccess 

Due: 2020/03/23

ZeroAccess is a cyber attack. We provide you some data about ZeroAccess incidents (longitude and latitude) and 
geographical information.

Please tell me does UFO cause ZeroAccess infection?


### HW#02: Orange

Due: 2020/03/30

Network Intrusion Detection on Kaggle  
https://www.kaggle.com/sampadab17/network-intrusion-detection-using-python

You need include the following mechanisms by Orange (but not limited to)
- feature engineering
- at least 5 different models
- k-fold validation
- Evaluation index

### HW#03: PCA

Due: 2020/04/16


### HW#04: Static Analysis

Due: 2020/04/13

Extract features from 40 malware samples and try to classify/cluster them into 4 groups.


### HW#05: Dynamic Analysis

Due: 2020/04/20

Try to cluster these dynamic analysis profiles: [hooklog419](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1N7soVI07VrL7j-ZDZ0X6Q25XOQptamu8)

### HW#06: KDD CUP 99

Try KDDCup99 data. Here is my analysis. You may add any classifiers to analyze the data.
Read this first! http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html 


### HW#07: Spam Mail Detection


### HW#08: PE Files Classification by NN

- Given a set of malware PE files and their malware family labels.
- Please design a deep neural network to classify these PE files into their families.

### HW#09: Autoencoder versus PCA

Base on your #HW08 (#HW08 has been updated as well) and try to design a NN-based classifier (need to include an autoencoder) to classify malware samples into the correct family.

- Q1: PCA or AutoEncoder? Which is better for data representation?
- Q2: What is your design of NN? Your classification accuracy rate?
- Q3: Implement certain ML algorithms on the same dataset. ML is better or NN is better?
